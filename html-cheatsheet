All html starts with <something> and ends with </something> this is an element
html files dictate the basic makeup of the site

An element is a way of indicating what the contents of the page should be. 
The <> and </> tags indicate what the content between the tags should be.
Opening tags can have an additional attribute within them. This is how image tags work.
An attribute has a name for what it is and a value to it.
In addition you can use elements inside other elements, this is called Nesting elements.
The whole element must be contained in the other element. (<p> <strong> </strong> </p>)

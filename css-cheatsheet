A css file is in essense the way the web page looks. 
html dictates where items are placed and what their function is while css dictates how they look.

In css an element is called a rulesheet. 
Consisting of a selector, the declaration, the property and the value of the property
wrapped in { } 
Within each declaration there must be a : to seperate the property from it's value
The ; is used to seperate each declaration from the next

The selector dictates what element on the html this ruleset should affect
The declaration is a single rule in the set specifying which properties to style
The properties allows you to tell the ruleset what attribute to affect, 
The property value is the appearance of that attribute
